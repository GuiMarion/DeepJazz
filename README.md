# DeepJazz
A Neural Network Jazz standard generation project


This project is about Jazz standards generation using Deep Neural Networks.
We are trying to learn Jazz grammar from a big dataset containaing Jazz standars from well known RealBook standards. 
A part of the implementation is taken from DeepBach Project conducted by GaÃ«tan Hadjeres at the CSL, you can find the licence in the file LICENCE of this directory.
