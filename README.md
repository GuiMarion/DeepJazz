# DeepJazz
A Neural Network Jazz standard generation project


This project is about Jazz standards generation with Deep Neural Networks.
We are trying to learn Jazz grammar from a big dataset containaing Jazz standars from well known RealBook. 
First we are trying to generate from this trained network, after we will try to 
implement a reiforcement learning to take account of the preferences of the user. 

A part of the implementation is taken from DeepBach Project directed by François Pachet at the CSL, you can find the licence in the file LICENCE of this directory.
